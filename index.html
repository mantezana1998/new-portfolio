                <h1>Max Antezana</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Max Antezana and I'm a software engineer based in Belmont, CA. In 2021, I was working as a registered behavior technician where I helped children learn independence, reduce maladaptive behavior in any settings, and worked side-by-side with case managers to create short-term and long-term goals for all three of my clients. I transitioned to computer science because my love for technology couldn't wait and I was eager to learn the process of full-stack applications and what makes them tic.</p>
